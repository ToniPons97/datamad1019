# I am Antonio Pons

    * I'm from Maracaibo, Venezuela
    * I write and record my own songs and also have a strong interest in mathematics and programming
    * I have a little experience in programming/data

    # I'm here to gain a toolbox for analyzing data and improve myself in the process

    * One of my dearest friends recommended Ironhack for expanding my education
    * I expect to learn a handful of methods and different ways to process data to extract objective information about large data sets

    # After finishing the bootcamp I pretend to get a job 

    * I would look for a job in any field as long as I get to apply the skills earned here at Ironhack
    * I have no idea what my future role would be
    * My carrer goal is to solve problems involving data through the methods learned here; it could be as an employee or as a bussines owner...I'm not sure yet
